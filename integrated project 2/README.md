## Sales funnel and A/A/B test analysis
### Project description:

The goal is to investigate user behavior for a startup that sells food products.

The project involves studying the sales funnel and looking at the results of an A/A/B test.

The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. We need to find out which set of fonts produces better results.

### Description of the data
Each log entry is a user action or an event.

`EventName` — event name

`DeviceIDHash` — unique user identifier

`EventTimestamp` — event time

`ExpId` — experiment number: 246 and 247 are the control groups, 248 is the test group
