## Robot-run cafe in Los Angeles
### Project description:

The goal is to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so attracting investors is what's needed, and they’re interested in the current market conditions.

Our goal is to prepare some market research based on open-source data on restaurants in LA and to determine whether it will be possible to maintain cafe's success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off.
