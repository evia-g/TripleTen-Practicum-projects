## What makes a game succeed?

__Project description:__

Online store Ice sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.

In this project we're going to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns for 2017.
