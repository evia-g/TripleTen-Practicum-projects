# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

Our project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We’ll need to find out if a customers' marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

Our report will be considered when building the **credit score** of a potential customer. The **credit score** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Description of the data
- `children` - the number of children in the family
- `days_employed` - work experience in days
- `dob_years` - client's age in years
- `education` - client's education

- `family_status` - marital status
- `family_status_id` - marital status identifier
- `gender` - gender of the client
- `income_type` - type of employment
- `debt` - was there any debt on loan repayment
